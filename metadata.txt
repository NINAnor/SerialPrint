about=The Serial Print updates and exports a print composer to image or PDF for every layer from a user defined list of layers. Each layer is individually added to the selected composer map and legend for map production. It allows for example to easily produce a series of images / documents, where the general map layout (background maps, north arrow, and other composer items) is unchanged and only the single selected layers are added. It can be useful e.g. for creating a map for each species in a given area or a series of thematic maps... It requires, that the current project contains at least one existing print composer with one map element and optionaly a legend.
